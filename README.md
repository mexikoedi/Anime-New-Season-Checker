# Anime New Season Checker

## What is this?
This is a Java program with a GUI which lets you check if an anime got a new season, how many seasons the anime already has and their runtime.

## Is this useful to me?
If you already use websites/applications/... which notify you every time an anime gets a new season then no. <br>
But otherwise if you always miss new seasons or if you are a person who uses bookmarks and checks them after sometime via manually searching in the browser for example then this might be something for you.

## How to install?
**You need [Java JDK 16](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or higher to use this program!** <br>
You can download it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or download the ZIP file over the releases tab. <br>
Extract the downloaded zip folder and then open the program by opening the .jar file. <br>
Before opening the .jar file open the "list.txt" file and add your anime titles and URLs to it. <br>
**Read below for more important information.**

## Limitations?
1) "list.txt" cannot be empty. <br>
2) Only use website URLs from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com). <br>
3) Use only correctly formatted URLS from IMDB after "source:". <br>
4) The .jar file and the "list.txt" file need to be in the same directory. <br>
5) **Follow the examples below.**

## How does it work?
After you entered a season number you need to click the search button. <br>
(The season number makes only sense for a small amount of anime. <br> 
If you have many anime titles and you only want to know which one has a new season then you don't need to enter a season number. <br> 
The season number is optional.) <br>
The Java program connects to the IMDB URLs from the .txt file and gets the data from there (seasons/runtime). <br> 
After that it checks if the data is correct and formats it accordingly. <br>
If something is wrong you will be notifed via popups. <br>
At the end all the data fills the text fields in the GUI.

## How fast is this program working?
This program uses parallel stream and is therefore fast enough to process a lot of anime titles. <br>
(A previous version of this program was single threaded and would become slower and slower the more anime titles you added.) <br>

For example: <br>
To get the data for over 230 anime titles the program needs roughly **1.3 minutes**. <br>
(One of the first versions needed for the same amount of anime titles roughly **5.7 minutes**.) <br>
(The program was once even faster, but because the server blocks too many requests, a safeguard was implemented that caps the maximum requests to prevent this issue.)

## Is the program working correctly?
Most of the time yes, but there are rare cases where for example a season is split in half and registered as new season or because of OVAs which are wrongly registered as new season or because of weird runtime information which were made at the IMDB website. <br>
This is the fault of IMDB and not of the program. <br>
If you see wrong data you could try to fix the data at the IMDB website. <br>
I tested it with over 160 anime titles and encountered 4 wrong season information (1 season too much) and 3 weird runtime information.

## Examples?
![list.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8403c690-8e08-42d7-acf1-85c22e744fd0 "list.txt") <br>
